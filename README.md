# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio, where I showcase the projects I have worked on while studying data science in Yandex Practicum. The projects are a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning problems, and include regression, classification, clustering, and time series analysis.

All data for projects was provided by Yandex Practcum.

The portfolio includes:
## 1. Age Validation Model
A machine learning model for validating the age of a customer based on their photo.
### Libraries used:
TensorFlow
Keras
Numpy
Matplotlib
OpenCV

## 2. Bank Client Reliability Analysis
This project is focused on exploring the reliability of bank clients using Python and the Pandas library. The aim is to analyze a large dataset of bank clients to gain insights into their reliability and develop a predictive model.
### Libraries used:
Pandas

## 3. Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the prices of cars. The project uses several popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to preprocess and explore the data, build and train models, and evaluate their performance. In addition to traditional linear regression, the project also employs more advanced models like CatBoostRegressor, lightgbm, RandomForestRegressor, and DummyRegressor to enhance the prediction accuracy. The project uses the cross_val_score method to evaluate the performance of each model and compares the results to determine the best model.
### Libraries used:
pandas
re
numpy
scikit-learn
catboost
lightgbm

## 4. Toxic Comment Validation Model

### Libraries used:
Pandas
NLTK
TQDM
Sklearn
CatBoost

## 5. Bank Client Churn Prediction Model
This project aims to predict the churn rate of bank clients. The goal is to provide insights to the bank in order to take proactive measures to retain clients and minimize the churn rate.
### Libraries used:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib

## 6. Data encryption algoritm
This project is about creating a machine learning model for encrypting client data. The goal of this project is to provide a secure method for protecting sensitive client information.
### Libraries used:
pandas

## 10. Telephony Company Rate Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting the best rate for a telephony company to offer to a client. The model is trained on telephony data, including the client's demographic information, the amount of minutes and data used, and the rate offered. The goal is to use this information to predict the best rate to offer to a new client.
### Libraries used:
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib

## 11. Real Estate Market Analysis
