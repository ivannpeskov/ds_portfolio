## Oil Well Location Selection using Machine Learning
in this project, we aim to build a machine learning model to help oil and gas companies choose the best location to drill an oil well. The model will predict the amount of oil in each well based on various features.

## Methodology
The machine learning model used in this project will be a linear regression model. This model will be trained on a sample of the data to learn the relationship between the various features and the oil in each well. The model will then be used to make predictions on new wells, allowing the companies to choose the best location to drill.

## Libraries Used
Pandas: To manage and manipulate the data
Sklearn: To train and evaluate the machine learning models
Numpy: To perform numerical operations
Matplotlib: To visualize the data and results
