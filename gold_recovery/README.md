### Gold Recovery Prediction Model
## Project Overview
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that predicts the gold recovery from ore. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about the gold recovery from different ores and the associated variables such as sulfur content, particle size, and pH levels. The goal of this project is to predict the gold recovery with a high degree of accuracy, using the information about the associated variables.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed by cleaning and transforming it into a suitable format for the machine learning model. The data was then divided into training and testing sets to ensure the accuracy of the model.

## Model Selection
Several machine learning models were trained on the preprocessed data, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as R-squared score, cross-validation score, and mean absolute error. The Random Forest Regressor was found to be the best-performing model and was selected for this project.

## Results
The Random Forest Regressor was trained on the preprocessed data, and the performance of the model was evaluated on the test data.
