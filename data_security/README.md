### Data encryption algoritm
This project is about creating a machine learning model for encrypting client data. The goal of this project is to provide a secure method for protecting sensitive client information. The model uses the python programming language and the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
The model is based on linear regression, and it uses the train_test_split function from scikit-learn to divide the data into training and testing sets. The performance of the model is evaluated using the r2_score metric.

The data used in this project is confidential and is not included in the repository. The StandardScaler class from scikit-learn is used to preprocess the data.

This project is a starting point for building a more robust and sophisticated solution for encrypting client data.
