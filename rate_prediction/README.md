## Telephony Company Rate Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting the best rate for a telephony company to offer to a client. The model is trained on telephony data, including the client's demographic information, the amount of minutes and data used, and the rate offered. The goal is to use this information to predict the best rate to offer to a new client.

The model was developed using the following libraries:

pandas
sklearn
matplotlib

### Model
The model uses a combination of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression, to make predictions. The algorithms were evaluated based on their accuracy score and the best performing algorithm was selected.
